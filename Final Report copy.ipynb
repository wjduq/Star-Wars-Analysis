    "We were trying to answer two questions with this analysis. First, are the characters with the most lines in the Star Wars movies also the most polarizing characters? That is, are they viewed by those that have seen the movies either very favorably or very unfavorably? Second, is there a physical trait that is common among the most polarizing characters? We will look at the polarization of characters compared to both script and description data frames to answer these questions. "

    "### FiveThirtyEight and List of Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "We took the following data set off of FiveThirtyEight. This data set contains results from a Star Wars survey. There are 1000 survey participants recorded. The csv was read in as a list of lists, which is a row centric approach to storing data from a csv. We then created a pandas data frame using this list of lists. From here we were able to clean the data and chang the values for how favorable a certain character to a scale that only measures polarization. Since the values for all of the characters were of the form \"Very favorably\", \"Somewhat favorably\", \"Neither favorably nor unfavorably (neutral)\", 'Somewhat unfavorably', 'Unfamiliar (N/A)', and 'Very unfavorably'. Since we wanted to measure polarization, it made sense to make the responses that were \"Very favorably\" or \"Very unfavorably\" weighted the most. We assigned values of 2 to wherever these values appeared in the data frame. After this, we were able to sum up polarization values, which were stored in a dictionary, and added this to a pandas data frame."
